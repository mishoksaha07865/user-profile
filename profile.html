            "Hi, I'm mishok saha. I'm currently working at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on the problem of how to build supercomputers that are a thousands times faster than what we have today but using only twice as much power --- about 20 megaWatts. I took my PhD at UArizona under David Lowenthal, I have an honors undergrad degree in Theater, and I'm spinning up a side project that applies theatrical performance theory to computer code. I also have an interest in bibliography (particularly mathematical bibliography) and how Wikipedia can be used to improve scholarship in this area."

The point of the question is to give the interviewer several "hooks" for follow-up questions, in this case, "supercomputers", "megaWatts", "UArizona", "performance theory", "mathematical bibliography" and "Wikipedia".

I wouldn't mention awards or accomplishments --- those should be in your resume, and they're awkward conversation starters (and you'll probably come across as both insecure and bragging if you do mention them). For your areas of specialization you should wait for the follow-up questions before getting into technical jargon (e.g., "dramaturgical approach to performative aspects of interfaces" might be more correct, but it shuts down potential conversation). Leave out more common interests for the same reason (e.g., "I like cats." Not a lot you can do with that.).

Basically, you want to come across as both technically and conversationally competent.
